# EAD-Lib
 Decompilation of libraries present in NSMBU that were developed by Nintendo EAD (now EPD).  

## sead
 Nintendo EAD's standard library / framework.  

## nw_ptcl
 Subset of `sead`, serving as a wrapper for the [NintendoWareForCafe Eft](https://github.com/nw4f/Eft) library.  

## agl
 Nintendo EAD's main graphics library.  

# Goal
 The original goal was to get a 1:1 decompilation of all sead (only) classes/methods present in NSMBU. However, that is sadly impossible for many reasons including no access to the compiler version used in NSMBU.  
 Later on, the goal was changed to include many of Nintendo EAD's other libraries.  
 While a 1:1 decompilation is impossible, the current goal is to create code with 1:1 functionality and no less efficiency than the original code.
